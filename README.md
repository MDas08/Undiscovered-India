## Inspiration
We were inspired by our experience as college students with a low budget. We want to give people with lower incomes or adventurers a chance to travel as much as they can.

## What it does
It's a virtual map of India where we have pinned certain places and on hovering you can learn more about it.

## How we built it
The project was designed on Figma and coded using HTML and CSS.

## Challenges we ran into
Due to scheduling conflicts, we couldn't start with the project until very late and unfortunately could not finish.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Not giving up. We have a nice idea so we'll work on it more after the Hackathon so that we can have a finished project.

## What we learned
How to plan for projects better. We really need to start ideation early.

## What's next for Undiscovered India
Completing the project and adding more places to visit!
